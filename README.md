# This repository is now abandoned.

# Transmission Remote GUI

**This is a fork of a fork**. If you're looking for the community-maintained version, go [here](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui/). If you're looking for the original project, go [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/transgui/).

This place is meant to be a temporary home for Transmission Remote GUI as both the community-maintained version and the original project appear to be dormant.

# Compiling

You need to clone the repository with submodules, and then use `lazbuild` to build :

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lighterowl/transgui.git
cd transgui
lazbuild transgui.lpi
```

If you hit trouble, have a look at `build_` scripts in the `.github` folder. They are used to build the project for each of the supported platforms in GitHub Actions. If you can run Docker containers, you might find it easier to just use [`lighterowl/transgui-sdk`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lighterowl/transgui-sdk/) which includes the proper versions of FPC and Lazarus.

Due to issues with fpc 3.2.2 mentioned below, it is recommended to build transgui with a development version of the Free Pascal compiler. The `build_` scripts include necessary code that downloads and compiles the development version from source.

Also, due to the fix for [one issue](https://github.com/lighterowl/transgui/issues/25), there was a need to introduce a change to Lazarus code. This version of transgui thus now uses [my own fork of Lazarus](https://gitlab.com/dkk089/lazarus/-/tree/transgui). If you don't want to use it, just remove the offending line when compiling with upstream Lazarus - stuff will still work.

You're encouraged to read the [wiki](https://github.com/lighterowl/transgui/wiki) if you're looking into making changes yourself.

# Changes made

This list applies to the first release of this fork : please look into release notes for individual releases in order to see what else changed since then.

 * transgui is now compiled with Free Pascal 3.2.3 and Lazarus 2.2.6 due to two rather serious bugs in parsing JSON in older versions ([38618](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/fpc/source/-/issues/38618) and [38624](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/fpc/source/-/issues/38624)).
 * The program binary is now compiled in Release mode.
 * Old makefiles were removed and all compilation is now handled via `lazbuild`.
 * Gzip compression is now used when talking to the daemon.
 * OpenSSL version was switched to version 3.0, making it possible to use TLS 1.3.

# Disclaimer

 * I last touched Pascal between 2001 and 2003.
 * I've never seriously worked with Lazarus.
 * Neither Windows nor macOS are platforms that I use daily.

`tl;dr` Please don't expect swooping changes to the program's behaviour or UI here, just hacks upon hacks at best.
